## Fibonacci sequence

Fibonacci sequence is a well-known sequence named after italian mathematician Leonardo da
Pisa, also known as Fibonacci.

Starting with ``F_1=F_2=1``, each following number ``F_n`` is determined by summing up the two previous numbers ``F_{n-1}`` and ``F_{n-2}``.
```math
F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}
```
